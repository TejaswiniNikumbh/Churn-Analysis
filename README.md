### Project Overview

The churn rate analysis project aims to:

- Determine the churn rate over specific time periods.
- Identify patterns and trends in customer churn.
- Visualize churn rate data to gain a better understanding of its behavior.
- Analyze customer segments and attributes related to churn.
- Provide an interactive dashboard to explore and share the findings.

### Tools Used

The project utilizes two key tools for churn rate analysis:

1. **Excel:** Data preparation and initial analysis are performed in Excel, leveraging its spreadsheet capabilities and formula functionalities to calculate churn rates and prepare the data for visualization.

2. **Power BI:** Power BI is employed for advanced data visualization, allowing for the creation of interactive dashboards and reports. It enables the exploration of churn rate trends, customer segmentation, and the identification of actionable insights.

### Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**: Import or input the churn data into Excel. Clean and format the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Calculate churn rates by dividing the number of customers who churned within a specific period by the total number of customers at the beginning of that period.

2. **Visualize Churn Data**: Create visualizations in Excel to represent churn rate trends over time. Utilize line charts, column/bar charts, and pivot tables to summarize churn rates by different customer segments or attributes.

3. **Import Data into Power BI**: Transfer the prepared data from Excel to Power BI for more advanced analysis and visualization.

4. **Create Churn Rate Visualizations in Power BI**: Leverage Power BI's data modeling capabilities to establish relationships between different tables if required. Design interactive visualizations, including line charts, bar/column charts, and slicers, to explore and analyze churn rate trends and customer segmentation.

5. **Apply Filters and Interactivity**: Utilize Power BI's filtering and slicing capabilities to drill down into specific time periods, customer segments, or dimensions. Add interactivity to visualizations, such as drill-through functionality or tooltips, to provide more detailed information on specific data points.

6. **Publish and Share the Churn Analysis Dashboard**: Publish the churn analysis dashboard to the Power BI service. Share the published dashboard with relevant stakeholders to enable them to explore and gain insights from the churn data.
